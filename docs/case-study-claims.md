# Case Study: Claims Platform (Regulated)

**Context:** A health insurer with 20+ services had inconsistent logs, PII leakage risk, and fragile dashboards.

**Approach**
- Adopted Cerbi governance profile (HIPAA starter + team rules).
- Enabled Roslyn analyzer in CI to block policy violations pre-merge.
- Deployed runtime validator in **relax-mode** to redact/flag without losing signals.
- Standardized correlation fields (app/env/tenant/trace).

**Outcomes (first 8 weeks)**
- **-28%** indexed fields from rollups and dedupe.
- **Fewer broken charts:** stable field names/types across releases.
- **Audit-ready:** versioned profiles + violation metadata traceability.
