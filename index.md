## ✨ Why CerbiStream Exists

> CerbiStream is a tool built to help applications log information **accurately and consistently**.

Logging is how apps keep track of what's happening behind the scenes. When something goes wrong, logs tell you exactly what happened, so you can quickly fix the issue.

Nowadays, many companies rely on **multiple teams or contractors** to build parts of their software, which often leads to **messy or inconsistent logging**.

Cerbi fixes that.

- ✅ Sets clear, enforced rules for what should be logged
- ✅ Helps teams keep their logs consistent, structured, and secure
- ✅ Ensures logs are **ready for audit, monitoring, or machine learning**

Cerbi is **modular**, so you can use just the parts you need.

---

## 🚀 What is Cerbi?

**Cerbi** is a modular observability platform offering precise control over how logs are generated, enriched, encrypted, validated, and routed.

Unlike traditional log aggregators, Cerbi enhances logging **at the source**, ensuring consistency, security, and compliance before the logs ever leave your service.

> Cerbi is **not here to replace** major log tools — it's designed to **enhance and complement** them. Use CerbiStream to log, then send it anywhere: your queue, your sink, or through CerbIQ for governance-aware routing and optional ML analysis.

> Cerbi offers Serilog-level speed with dramatically lower memory usage, plus unmatched governance support and modular ML-friendly architecture.

## 🔀 Hybrid-Compatible by Design

Cerbi is built to integrate **with**, not against, your stack. Use only what you need:

- ✅ Use **CerbiStream** as a logger, send logs to your existing sink (Splunk, Datadog, etc.)
- ✅ Or route logs with **CerbIQ** for schema validation, queue normalization, and ML-ready structuring
- ✅ Only **CerbIQ** can forward metadata (not NPI by default) to **CerbiSense**, the shared AI insights engine

Cerbi is about precision at the source. **You own the routing, we offer optional intelligence**.

I'm also gathering **non-sensitive** data from these logs—no personal info like names or addresses, just general metadata—**only with user permission**. This lets us pool data to analyze and spot trends or common issues everyone can benefit from.

## 🧠 How the Cerbi Ecosystem Flows

Cerbi enables total control from log creation to insight generation. You choose how deep to go:

```
Your App (ILogger<T>)
        |
        v
+------------------+
|  CerbiStream     |  <- Your structured logger
|  (adds metadata) |
+------------------+
        |
        v
+------------------+
|  Encryption Layer|
+------------------+
        |
        v
+------------------+
|  Message Queue   |
+------------------+
     |           |
     |           +--> Your Sink (Splunk, Datadog, etc.)
     |
     +--> CerbIQ (Optional Routing/Governance Layer)
              |
              v
       (optional) CerbiSense
       (only from CerbIQ, metadata only)
```

### 🔄 Routing Options

- **CerbiStream → Queue → Your Sink**  
  Keep your current stack. Cerbi just ensures logs are validated and consistent before reaching your destination.

- **CerbiStream → Queue → CerbIQ → Your Sink**  
  Add **governance-aware routing**: CerbIQ can normalize, filter, and validate schemas before sending to your sink.

- **CerbiStream → Queue → CerbIQ → CerbiSense (optional)**  
  If enabled, CerbIQ can forward **non-NPI metadata only** to CerbiSense for **global pattern analysis**, **risk scoring**, and **shared anomaly detection dashboards**.

### ♻️ Garbage-Free Logging

CerbiStream emits structured logs with only **320B per log** and no Gen 0/1/2 collections observed during BenchmarkDotNet tests.

✅ **GC-friendly by design** — ideal for APIs, games, IoT, and real-time workloads.

---

## 🙅 What Cerbi Is Not

Let’s set clear expectations:

- ❌ Not a log aggregator like Splunk or Datadog
- ❌ Not a file-based logger (but file fallback is coming soon!)
- ❌ Not a rigid pipeline — use only what you need

Cerbi is modular, developer-first, and designed for precision and compliance.
