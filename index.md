# CerbiSuite – Unified Logging, Governance, and Observability

> 🔐 Structured Logging · 🧠 Developer-First Observability · 🌐 Cloud-Native & Portable

---

## 🚀 What is Cerbi?

**Cerbi** is a modular observability platform offering precise control over how logs are generated, enriched, encrypted, validated, and routed.

Unlike traditional log aggregators, Cerbi enhances logging **at the source**, ensuring consistency, security, and compliance before the logs ever leave your service.

> Cerbi is **not here to replace** major log tools — it's designed to **enhance and complement** them. Use CerbiStream to log, then send it anywhere: your queue, your sink, or through CerbIQ for governance-aware routing and optional ML analysis.

> Cerbi offers Serilog-level speed with dramatically lower memory usage, plus unmatched governance support and modular ML-friendly architecture.

## 🔀 Hybrid-Compatible by Design

Cerbi is built to integrate **with**, not against, your stack. Use only what you need:

- ✅ Use **CerbiStream** as a logger, send logs to your existing sink (Splunk, Datadog, etc.)
- ✅ Or route logs with **CerbIQ** for schema validation, queue normalization, and ML-ready structuring
- ✅ Only **CerbIQ** can forward metadata (not NPI by default) to **CerbiSense**, the shared AI insights engine

Cerbi is about precision at the source. **You own the routing, we offer optional intelligence**.

> 🧱 Modular & Decoupled:
> - Logs are sent to **your queue**.
> - You can:
>   - ✅ Route them to your own sink directly
>   - ✅ Use **CerbIQ** to inspect, enrich, and route to sink + **optionally** send metadata to **CerbiSense**
