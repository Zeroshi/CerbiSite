## ✨ Why CerbiStream Exists

> CerbiStream isn't a website—it's a tool built to help applications log information **accurately and consistently**.

Logging is how apps keep track of what's happening behind the scenes. When something goes wrong, logs tell you exactly what happened, so you can quickly fix the issue.

Nowadays, many companies rely on **multiple teams or contractors** to build parts of their software, which often leads to **messy or inconsistent logging**.

Cerbi fixes that.

- ✅ Sets clear, enforced rules for what should be logged
- ✅ Helps teams keep their logs consistent, structured, and secure
- ✅ Ensures logs are **ready for audit, monitoring, or machine learning**

Cerbi is **modular**, so you can use just the parts you need.

## 🚀 What is Cerbi?

**Cerbi** is a modular observability platform offering precise control over how logs are generated, enriched, encrypted, validated, and routed.

Unlike traditional log aggregators, Cerbi enhances logging **at the source**, ensuring consistency, security, and compliance before the logs ever leave your service.

> Cerbi is **not here to replace** major log tools — it's designed to **enhance and complement** them. Use CerbiStream to log, then send it anywhere: your queue, your sink, or through CerbIQ for governance-aware routing and optional ML analysis.

> Cerbi offers Serilog-level speed with dramatically lower memory usage, plus unmatched governance support and modular ML-friendly architecture.

## 🔀 Hybrid-Compatible by Design

Cerbi is built to integrate **with**, not against, your stack. Use only what you need:

- ✅ Use **CerbiStream** as a logger, send logs to your existing sink (Splunk, Datadog, etc.)
- ✅ Or route logs with **CerbIQ** for schema validation, queue normalization, and ML-ready structuring
- ✅ Only **CerbIQ** can forward metadata (not NPI by default) to **CerbiSense**, the shared AI insights engine

Cerbi is about precision at the source. **You own the routing, we offer optional intelligence**.

I'm also gathering **non-sensitive** data from these logs—no personal info like names or addresses, just general metadata—**only with user permission**. This lets us pool data to analyze and spot trends or common issues everyone can benefit from.

> 🧱 Modular & Decoupled:
>
> Logs are sent to your queue. You can:
>
> - ✅ Route them to your sink
> - ✅ Use CerbIQ to inspect, normalize, and route
> - ✅ Optionally forward anonymized metadata to CerbiSense for ML analysis

CerbiSense provides **global trends** and pattern recognition based on shared, non-sensitive metadata — a benefit for any team that opts in.
